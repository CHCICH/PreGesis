# Login Process

To log in, the system processes the `req.body` which includes the `UserEmail` or `username`, `mode`, and `UserPassword`. The `UserEmail` or `username` is utilized to identify the user, while the `mode` specifies the authentication method (e.g., email or username). The `UserPassword` is then validated against the stored credentials. If the credentials are correct, the user is authenticated and granted access to the system.
