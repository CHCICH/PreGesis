content reserved for the users
additionnally if the user have the admin role or the math mod role the user will have access to the admin/ math mod menu a page restricted to a user 
/login
takes in the body of the request the credentials and sends the data to the api which will hash the data and compare it with the data in the DB of course there will be error
handling but the error handling should be multithreaded in other words it should accomodate for all errors present not an error after the other

/signp is the same but it should ask for extra informations like the users Name 

/generator will give the access to the previous questions generator 
/generator/:topic will give access to the generator of the topic's questions the model can be tuned and filter certain questions depending on the diffuclity and the 
topic needed in other words the model should be perfectly accomodated
